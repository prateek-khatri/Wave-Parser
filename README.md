# Wave-Parser
This simple module, reads and validates WAV file headers. This program can be used to correct the duration mismatch errors in RIFF Type WAV files.

Please note, the header is assumed to be 44 bytes and not 48. Changes to data offset and header structure would be needed to accomodate for that.


Enjoy!
